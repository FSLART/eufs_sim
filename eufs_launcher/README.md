# EUFS GUI Launcher

## How To Use

Basic instructions can be found in the main repository README.  Here lie the advanced usage notes.

### Editing the GUI's UI

If you don't like the layout, in `eufs_launcher/resource` there exists a file `Launcher.ui`.
If you want to do basic layout editing, it should be self explanatory how to edit this file.
If you want to add whole new options on startup, you will want to direct yourself to `eufs_launcher/srs/eufs_launcher/LauncherModule.py`,
but if you're at that point, you might as well just get in touch with the simulation team and let them handle it.

### Image-to-Track

(TODO explain how to handmake an image and where all relevant files are)
